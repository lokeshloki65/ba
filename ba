1. Open Excel and enter your sample data in one column (e.g., A1:A10).
Example data: 14, 16, 15, 17, 13, 18, 15, 16, 14, 17


2. Enable Data Analysis ToolPak:

Go to File → Options → Add-ins.

Select Excel Add-ins → Go → Check “Analysis ToolPak” → OK.



3. Run the One-Sample T-Test:

Click Data → Data Analysis → t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances (Excel doesn’t have a direct “one-sample t-test,” so compare your data column to a column filled with the hypothesized mean, e.g., 12).

Select:

Variable 1 Range: Your sample data

Variable 2 Range: Hypothesized mean values (e.g., all cells = 12)

Hypothesized Mean Difference: 0

Output Range: Choose where to display results



4. Click OK to generate the results.
Excel will output values such as:

Statistic	Value
Mean	15.5
Hypothesized Mean	12
df	9
t Stat	2.73
P(T<=t) two-tail	0.018
t Critical two-tail	2.26
